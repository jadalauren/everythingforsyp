    <h1>My Pokemon Gallery</h1>
    <p>When I was a child, i would watch pokemon when the was nothing else to watch on tv. I was never a huge fan of pokemon until the game came 
        out on mobil devices. I loved playing Pokemon go for the thrill, though I never learned the names. My parents did not like that I had the 
        game on my phone and made me delete it it. Since then, I have never been into Pokemon, but the characters are still adorable and cool to look at.
